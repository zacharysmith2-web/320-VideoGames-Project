The data that I will be working with will be based the popularity of video games from 1980 to 2023. My interest in the data set comes from my enjoyment of playing video games and because I have a lot of friends that are indie game developers and work in game design we talk a lot about the popularity of games and how certain genres will do better than others and how the game market is doing. When it comes to where I got my data from I got it from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023/data. Some research questions that can be answered using this data set are, can we identify a trend in game genre vs rating? Is there a correlation between release date and rating, i.e were people giving higher scores back in the day compared to now.

Codebook: The original data was gathered using a website called Backloggd where it has a collection of video games where people can rate the game and show how much they have played the game and give typed out reviews for the game. 
- Title = Title of the Game
- Release Date = Date of release of the game's first version
- Team = Game developer team
- Rating = Average rating
- Times Listed = Number of users who listed the game
- Number of Reviews = Number of reviews received from the users
- Genres = All genres pertaining to a specific game
- Summary = Summary of game provided by the team
- Reviews = User typed out reviews.
